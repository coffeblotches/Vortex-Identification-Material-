# Vortex-Identification-Material-
The  vortex structures found on the solar surface have proven to be the a source of generation of MHD (Magneto-Hydro Dynamics) waves responsible for the channelling of energy from the foot-points to spatial scales of the Sun.  For the identification of these vortexes I used a combination of the PIV and POD (Particle Image Velocimetry and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition) methods along with the Fourier Local Correlation Tracking (FLCT) in order to obtain the 2-D velocity field of the data obtained from SST/CRISP. I am currently working towards researching other methods (Direct Lyapunov Exponents  along with Lambda-2 method) so as to obtain faster and more efficient results for the vortex identification per frame.
